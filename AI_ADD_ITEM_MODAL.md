# AI-Powered Add Item Modal

## Overview
The Add Item modal has been redesigned to provide a smarter, more intuitive product upload experience using AI-powered image analysis. The flow starts minimal and expands dynamically based on user actions and AI responses.

## Features

### üß± Step 1: Initial State (Minimal UI)
- **Item Name**: Free text input for the product name
- **Image Upload**: Allow uploading one or more images
- **Generate Description Button**: Primary action button to trigger AI analysis

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: AI-Powered Enrichment
When the user uploads an image and clicks "Generate Description":
1. The first uploaded image is sent to Google's Gemini API
2. Gemini analyzes the image and returns:
   - A realistic, human-style item description
   - The best matching category from predefined list
   - 1-4 relevant attribute field names

### üñºÔ∏è Step 3: Expanded Fields (After AI Response)
The UI dynamically expands to show:
- **Category Dropdown**: Auto-selected with AI suggestion, editable
- **Description Textarea**: Pre-filled with AI-generated description, editable
- **Attribute Fields**: Dynamic form fields based on AI suggestions
  - Field names are editable
  - Values can be filled in by the user

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created:
1. **`src/services/geminiService.js`** - New service for Gemini API integration
2. **`src/components/pages/MyProfilePage/AddItemModal/AddItemModal.jsx`** - Completely rewritten modal
3. **`src/components/pages/MyProfilePage/AddItemModal/AddItemModal.css`** - Updated styling for new UI elements

### Key Components:

#### GeminiService

- Parses JSON responses
- Error handling for API failures

#### AddItemModal
- State management for AI generation process
- Dynamic form expansion based on AI response

- Form validation and submission

### API Integration
- Uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- Sends image as base64 with structured prompt
- Expects JSON response with description, category, and fields
- Handles API errors gracefully
